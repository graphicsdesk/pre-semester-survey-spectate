Between Aug. 18 and Aug. 23, we received 1,362 responses from students of all class years and undergraduate colleges at Columbia. Here are their thoughts on the first fully in-person semester in a year and a half. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Diverse living experiences during the pandemic</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Without a campus to unite students in Morningside Heights, the last 18 months saw a variety of living conditions for both new and returning undergraduate students. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though 44.9 percent of respondents resided in New York City at some point during the pandemic, the differences were stark across class years: 72.2 percent of respondents from the class of <b>2022 lived in New York City at some point in the last 18 months, while only 17.5 percent of first-years had done the same.</b> </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Overall, 79.5 percent of respondents did not live on campus in the last 18 months.</b> This includes nearly all of the first-years who did not reside in Columbia Housing and <b>approximately two-thirds of each of the remaining classes</b><b>.</b> For each class, there was a portion of students who lived in New York City at some point in the last 18-months, but never in Columbia Housing. While many of the students in this category are likely those whose primary place of residence is New York City, this percentage was particularly high for the class of 2022: 40.4 of seniors reported living in off-campus housing in the city at some point during the pandemic, while only 17.2% of first-year students reported the same. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Despite the apparent prevalence in some classes of off-campus housing, the majority (54.6%) of respondents did not live in New York City—on campus or otherwise—at any point in the last 18 months. Furthermore, 40.7 percent reported spending the entirety of the last 18 months at home. In particular, of the 535 juniors and seniors who responded to the survey, 125—23 percent—only lived at their primary residence. This group includes students in all four undergraduate schools. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Students look forward to reconnecting with each other</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Out of all of the class years, the class of 2025 reported the highest rates of feeling the fear of missing out in the last 18 months, with 81 percent of first-years responding “yes” to the question, “Have you felt FOMO (fear of missing out) at any point of the last 18 months?” These anxieties were not unique, as over 70 percent of respondents from every other class year also reported experiencing FOMO. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Respondents also rated how connected they felt to the Columbia community on a 10-point scale, with zero being “not at all connected” and 10 being “extremely connected.” The answers did not vary significantly between class years even though juniors and seniors alike spent at least a semester at Columbia prior to the onset of the pandemic. In fact, every class year rated their connectedness to Columbia between 4 and 5 on average. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Living situations generally did not have a significant effect on how connected students felt to Columbia.</b> The only exception was the small proportion of respondents who had <b>only lived away from home</b><b>—</b>the most reported rating for these students was a 2 on the 10-point scale. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The survey included space at the end for students to share any of their thoughts about the upcoming semester. Of the 208 written responses received, <b>15 percent explicitly mentioned wanting to return to in-person learning and activities for the sake of their social, emotional, and mental health</b>. In addition, only 52.2 percent of respondents felt very prepared to connect or reconnect with their college communities this semester. While some students shared anxieties about readjusting to campus, only 7.2 percent of all students who responded to the survey reported feeling extremely concerned about their social life this semester. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Meanwhile, 9.2 percent of respondents reported the highest possible level of concern regarding academics, while 22.7 percent of respondents did so when asked to rate the importance of career planning to them this semester. <b>In general, students are ready to be a part of the Columbia community and regain the social interaction afforded by an in-person semester.</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Student COVID-19 predictions are pessimistic</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> On top of housing, academic, career, and social adjustments, 68.5 percent of seniors, 60 percent of juniors, 48.7 percent of sophomores, and 54.5 percent of first years reported that they were very concerned about COVID-19 and its variants. When looking at both the mean and median of these responses per class, seniors have the highest concern out of all class years. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The University monitors the number of COVID-19 cases per day in New York City as one of the metrics for determining campus risk level and possible policy changes. Over the course of the survey, 82.4 percent of respondents predicted that the number of COVID-19 cases in New York City would have risen by Sept. 1, whereas the remaining 17.6 percent of respondents thought the numbers would fall. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> On Aug, 18, the seven-day average number of cases was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-city-new-york-covid-cases.html">2,018</a>, which fluctuated to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-city-new-york-covid-cases.html">1,954</a> cases by Aug. 23. On Sept. 1, the seven-day average number of cases was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-city-new-york-covid-cases.html">1,838</a>. Within our surveyed population, first-years were more optimistic about the cases in the city decreasing between the date they submitted their survey and Sept. 1st, but as most survey respondents predicted, the overall number of cases grew by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-city-new-york-covid-cases.html">15,932</a> between Aug. 24 and Sept. 1 while the seven-day average rate decreased. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Consistent with their predictions about increasing COVID-19 cases in New York, 76 percent of respondents predicted that Columbia’s policies regarding COVID-19 would change at some point during the semester. Only 3.3 percent predicted the policies would not change, while 20.7 percent were unsure. Since these predictions, the number of students, faculty, and staff at all Columbia facilities who tested positive for COVID-19 <b>rose to 50</b><a href="https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/columbia-surveillance-testing-results"><b> cases during the week of Sept. 13 from 25 cases during the week of Sept. 6. </b></a>As of 7 p.m. on Sept. 17, Columbia placed <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/09/17/columbia-implements-10-person-limit-on-indoor-gatherings-restricts-residence-hall-access-to-residents-only/">visiting restrictions</a> on its residence halls due to rising case numbers among the student population. The University has not mandated regular testing this semester for all Columbia affiliates as it did in past semesters, so the current data may not accurately represent the number of cases on campus. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Columbia’s response to COVID-19 is a continuing concern for many students</b> </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Of those who submitted a written response, 32 percent explicitly discussed concerns about returning to campus amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</b><b>.</b> Many responses expressed frustration at the idea that the requirement of returning to in-person classes was motivated more by financial reasons than concern for students’ well-being. Along a similar vein, 33 percent of respondents expressed high levels of anxiety or outrage at Columbia for not providing more options for students to continue their education without the increased risks of contracting the virus. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i> These quotes have been edited for length and clarity.</i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>“I think Columbia knows that we will have to go into another lockdown and is having us return to campus at the beginning of the semester</i><b>—</b><i>masked, which really impacts disabled students such as myself</i><b>—</b><i>only to ensure that students don’t defer a year.</i><b><i> I think this is a financial decision for them and not about the needs of the students. I would rather them be upfront about being virtual again so I can make a decision accordingly</i></b><i>.”</i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>“</i><i>My son is high risk. He can’t get vaccinated. I understand that student parents are a minority on campus, but goddamn. For more reasons than just COVID-19</i><b>—</b><i>but especially with COVID-19</i><b>—</b><i>Columbia has been a shit experience as a struggling parent. ... No one takes into consideration the fact that I’m caring for more than one human, and all approach it as if it’s “my problem,” which normally, I would agree, but fuck you for thinking that moms and dads don’t deserve to earn a degree</i><i>.”</i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>“</i><b><i>The school has absolutely failed in their handling of things this year</i></b><i>. It’s just a cycle of repeated failure. They have incredible opportunities to meet students where they are, offer multiple modalities (since the framework has been set up for it), and allow students to advance their degree without having to sacrifice their health…</i><b><i>The school’s position is not only irresponsible; it is disrespectful to the student community as well as the greater community that they so rely on</i></b><i>. As a change-maker school, I am deeply disappointed in absolutely everything they have done this year and their sheer disregard for the health of the students that afford them their unique reputation as a university.</i><b><i> If I am to contract COVID-19,, I will undoubtedly be very ill, and it will be entirely the fault of this school placing its students in the reckless position of choosing between their degree or their health.</i></b><b><i>”</i></b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Accordingly, 4.3 percent of responses conveyed disappointment with Columbia’s communication and decisions made in the past 18 months and looking forward. Though Columbia tried to keep students informed through the University Life Forums on COVID-19, vaccination, and students’ fall 2021 return, 76.9 percent of respondents reported having never attended one, so this means of communication<b>—</b>even if it included valuable information<b>—</b>was largely ineffective. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>“</i><b><i>Columbia’s policies right now are so unclear, and I’m very concerned about how policies will change throughout the semester and the lack of preparation and transparency with us so far. </i></b><i>… I am most concerned about how they expect us to stay home if sick but have not communicated that this will be taken into account with professors. Will we be penalized for missing class if we are sick? Will lectures be recorded? This means classes would have to be hybrid to accommodate this policy, but we have not heard anything about that. … </i><b><i>I have so many questions and concerns, and it feels like the University is not answering them.</i></b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Concern over COVID-19 is not enough to keep the mandate</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Some students felt very differently about the University’s COVID-19 policies, however, with<b> 5.8 percent of respondents who included written responses feeling like the COVID-19 protocol is too strict.</b> </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>“</i><i>Considering virtually every student is vaccinated or will be vaccinated shortly after the semester begins, </i><b><i>it is completely unacceptable for the school to have COVID-19 policies like mandating mask use for everyone indoors</i></b><i>, restricting guests to dorms, and limiting the use of Dodge Fitness Center. I would like to ask whoever is willing to answer what Columbia perceives to be the point where they cease to do these things, given that COVID-19 is not looking like something that will be completely eradicated any time soon. Particularly with guest policy in dorms and availability in Dodge, I was sold these two as guarantees when deciding on a college, and so was everyone else. </i><b><i>Restricting them is a massive disservice and frankly extremely disrespectful to the student body.</i></b><b><i>”</i></b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I am concerned socially, not for fear of catching COVID-19, but because the majority of clubs I participate in are performance- or conference-based. Because of Columbia’s new capacity restrictions on extracurricular and social gatherings, I am unsure how to stay involved. As a senior, I fear missing out on my last year of college life. I may never have another chance to do in-person theater (one of my passions) or simply go to a large party with college friends. It frustrates me even more because Columbia’s population is almost entirely vaccinated, making the restrictions feel pointless. I can go see a Broadway show at next-to-full capacity (or even an ‘academic event’ at Columbia), but clubs can’t have meetings with more than 25 people? It feels ridiculous.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “As a New York City resident, I know how bad the pandemic can get. My family and I stayed in the city throughout the very worst of it in March, April, and May of 2020. I remember the refrigerator trucks parked alongside my local hospital, the fact that sirens eventually became white noise. That being said, I wish the University loosened up on its restrictions. For the most part, Columbia’s students are young people who were low-risk for COVID-19 in the first place. Now, with the addition of the vaccine, I’m not concerned about most students’ ability to fight off even the more pernicious Delta variant. I understand that precautions must be taken to protect older members of the community such as professors, which is why I feel that a mask mandate in class is reasonable. Outside of class, however, I think students should be given more freedom to socialize with their peers free of COVID-19 restrictions. Lastly, I want to say that these are my thoughts as of August 2021, but given the fast-changing nature of the pandemic, I could feel very differently in a few short weeks.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Multiple students cited the University’s requirement for vaccination as reason to relax other restrictions such as indoor masking, student and guest access to buildings, and capacity restrictions to extracurricular clubs. According to the COVID-19 resource guide, University affiliates will not be allowed on campus unless they have met the vaccine requirement or received exemption, but <a href="https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/faqs-regarding-covid-19-vaccination">there will be no way</a> for individuals to verify each other’s vaccination status. The presence of vaccination exemptions was also a concern for multiple students responding to the survey. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While responses denouncing preventative COVID-19 protocols were vastly outnumbered by opposing viewpoints, the survey results also suggest that students may be reluctant to maintain current behaviors without the Columbia Community Health Compact. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Only 43 percent of respondents would continue wearing a mask if Columbia’s mask mandate was revoked, 28 percent would not continue wearing a mask, and another 29 percent were unsure of what they would do. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> This distribution is generally consistent between the four class years; however, <b>the class of 2022 had the highest percentage (50.2) of respondents who would continue wearing a mask, while the class of 2024 had the highest percentage (34.8) of respondents who would not. </b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Though the fall 2021 semester has physically reunited the Columbia community, students remain divided by their respective opinions on how to best navigate the recent return to campus. With cases on the rise and new dorm restrictions in place</b><b>, it is still uncertain whether the return to campus can be the return to normalcy that </b><b>many</b><b>we all</b><b> hope for. </b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Elizabeth Commisso is a Deputy Graphics editor.
