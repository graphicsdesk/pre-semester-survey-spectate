Between Aug. 18 and Aug. 23, we received 1,362 responses from students of all class years and undergraduate colleges at Columbia. Here are their thoughts on the first fully in-person semester in a year and a half. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Diverse living experiences during the pandemic</b> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Without a campus to unite students in Morningside Heights, the last 18 months saw a variety of living conditions for both new and returning undergraduate students. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though 44.9 percent of respondents resided in New York City at some point during the pandemic, the differences were stark across class years: 72.2 percent of respondents from the class of <b>2022 lived in New York City at some point in the last 18 months, while only 17.5 percent of first-years had done the same.</b> </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="graphic-name"> <p>Placeholder graphic in src/graphic-name.html</p> </div> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Elizabeth Commisso is a Deputy Graphics editor.
