        Of those who submitted a written response, 32 percent explicitly discussed concerns about returning to campus amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many responses expressed frustration at the idea that the requirement of returning to in-person classes was motivated more by financial reasons than concern for students&rsquo; well-being. Along a similar vein, 33 percent of respondents expressed high levels of anxiety or outrage at Columbia for not providing more options for students to continue their education without the increased risks of contracting the virus.

                    &ldquo;I think Columbia knows that we will have to go into another lockdown and is having us return to campus at the beginning of the semester&mdash;masked, which really impacts disabled students such as myself&mdash;only to ensure that students don&rsquo;t defer a year. I think this is a financial decision for them and not about the needs of the students. I would rather them be upfront about being virtual again so I can make a decision accordingly.&rdquo;

For more reasons than just COVID-19&mdash;but especially with COVID-19&mdash;Columbia has been a shit experience as a struggling parent. &hellip; No one takes into consideration the fact that I&rsquo;m caring for more than one human, and all approach it as if it&rsquo;s &lsquo;my problem,&rsquo; which normally, I would agree, but fuck you for thinking that moms and dads don&rsquo;t deserve to earn a degree.&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;The school has absolutely failed in their handling of things this year. It&rsquo;s just a cycle of repeated failure. They have incredible opportunities to meet students where they are, offer multiple modalities (since the framework has been set up for it), and allow students to advance their degree without having to sacrifice their health&hellip;The school&rsquo;s position is not only irresponsible; it is disrespectful to the student community as well as the greater community that they so rely on. As a change-maker school, I am deeply disappointed in absolutely everything they have done this year and their sheer disregard for the health of the students that afford them their unique reputation as a university. If I am to contract COVID-19, I will undoubtedly be very ill, and it will be entirely the fault of this school placing its students in the reckless position of choosing between their degree or their health.&rdquo;
