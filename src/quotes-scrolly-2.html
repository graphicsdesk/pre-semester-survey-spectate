            Some students felt very differently about the University&rsquo;s COVID-19 policies, however: 5.8 percent of respondents wrote that the University&rsquo;s COVID-19 policies are too strict.

                    &ldquo;Considering virtually every student is vaccinated or will be vaccinated shortly after the semester begins, it is completely unacceptable for the school to have COVID-19 policies like mandating mask use for everyone indoors, restricting guests to dorms, and limiting the use of Dodge Fitness Center. I would like to ask whoever is willing to answer what Columbia perceives to be the point where they cease to do these things, given that COVID-19 is not looking like something that will be completely eradicated any time soon. Particularly with guest policy in dorms and availability in Dodge, I was sold these two as guarantees when deciding on a college, and so was everyone else. Restricting them is a massive disservice and frankly extremely disrespectful to the student body.&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;I am concerned socially, not for fear of catching COVID-19, but because the majority of clubs I participate in are performance- or conference-based. Because of Columbia&rsquo;s new capacity restrictions on extracurricular and social gatherings, I am unsure how to stay involved. As a senior, I fear missing out on my last year of college life. I may never have another chance to do in-person theater (one of my passions) or simply go to a large party with college friends. It frustrates me even more because Columbia&rsquo;s population is almost entirely vaccinated, making the restrictions feel pointless. I can go see a Broadway show at next-to-full capacity (or even an &lsquo;academic event&rsquo; at Columbia), but clubs can&rsquo;t have meetings with more than 25 people? It feels ridiculous.&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;As a New York City resident, I know how bad the pandemic can get. My family and I stayed in the city throughout the very worst of it in March, April, and May of 2020. I remember the refrigerator trucks parked alongside my local hospital, the fact that sirens eventually became white noise. That being said, I wish the University loosened up on its restrictions. For the most part, Columbiaâ€™s students are young people who were low-risk for COVID-19 in the first place. Now, with the addition of the vaccine, I&rsquo;m not concerned about most students&rsquo; ability to fight off even the more pernicious Delta variant. I understand that precautions must be taken to protect older members of the community such as professors, which is why I feel that a mask mandate in class is reasonable. Outside of class, however, I think students should be given more freedom to socialize with their peers free of COVID-19 restrictions. Lastly, I want to say that these are my thoughts as of August 2021, but given the fast-changing nature of the pandemic, I could feel very differently in a few short weeks.&rdquo;
