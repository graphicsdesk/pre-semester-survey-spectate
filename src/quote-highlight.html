            &ldquo;Columbia&rsquo;s policies right now are so unclear, and I&rsquo;m very concerned about how policies will change throughout the semester and the lack of preparation and transparency with us so far. &hellip; I am most concerned about how they expect us to stay home if sick but have not communicated that this will be taken into account with professors. Will we be penalized for missing class if we are sick? Will lectures be recorded? This means classes would have to be hybrid to accommodate this policy, but we have not heard anything about that. &hellip; I have so many questions and concerns, and it feels like the University is not answering them.&rdquo;
